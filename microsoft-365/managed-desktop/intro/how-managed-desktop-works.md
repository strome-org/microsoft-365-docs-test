When you enroll in M365 Managed Desktop, Microsoft provides you with devices that are configured to join your Azure Active Directory tenant. Windows 10, Office 365, and some apps and features associated with [Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compare-all-microsoft-365-plans) are installed (by Microsoft) on your devices. When your employees who are using these devices need help, they contact M365 Managed Desktop support (provided by Microsoft) through a custom chat app.
