# Is Microsoft Managed Desktop right for you?

<!--from Overview-->

We’re always looking for ways to help make our customer’s workplace more productive and secure. The Microsoft 365 service starts by empowering employees to work together in a creative, secure device and app environment.  

Microsoft Managed Desktop expands on this vision by making sure our customers always have devices that can take advantage of the latest tools and technologies in a secure, monitored, and supported IT environment. This can help our customers:

- Provide devices that run enterprise-level features without having to staff an enterprise-level IT infrastructure. 
- Deploy apps, drivers, policies, and devices in a more secure, predictable manner. 
- Help stabilize and reduce total cost of ownership (TCO). 
- Facilitate new levels of security and monitoring to combat modern day threats.
