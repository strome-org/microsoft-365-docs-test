# Manage apps in Microsoft Managed Desktop

<!--Application management -->

Once applications are onboarded, managing them is shared between customers, Microsoft Managed Desktop operations, and Microsoft Managed Desktop support. 
Customers:
•	Ensure that appropriate licenses are in place for all software deployed through Intune 
•	Monitor their application deployment status
•	Manage application settings profiles for deployment
Microsoft Managed Desktop operations reviews app deployment notifications to ensure that no applications which violate Microsoft Managed Desktop terms are being deployed. 
Microsoft Managed Desktop support provides support for Microsoft Authored Applications (for example, Office).
