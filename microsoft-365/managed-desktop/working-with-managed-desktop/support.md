## Getting help: administrators

You can submit Support tickets or Feedback requests to Microsoft using the Microsoft Managed Desktop Administrative Portal. Support requests are always prioritized over Feedback submissions. Support requests will be reviewed and managed according to Severity as outlined earlier in this document. Feedback will be reviewed, and a response provided where requested. 

Contact operations by opening a Support request through the Microsoft 365 Managed Desktop admin portal.  Click on **+ New Support ticket** on the Support request tab in the admin portal.  

When you create your support request, choose the type that matches the kind of help you need.

Support request type | When to use
--- | ---
Request for information | Questions about device purchase history.
Incident | Something you need Microsoft Managed Desktop Operations Team to investigate, like apps not deploying correctly.
Change request | Something you want Microsoft Managed Desktop Operations Team to change, like moving devices between update ring.

## Getting help for end users

There are two ways that users in your organization can get help with their Microsoft Managed Desktop devices: **Get Help** app, or phone support. 

### Get Help app

The preferred method for providing support to your users is **Get Help**. 

![Get Help](images/get-help.png)

This is an application that’s installed on all Microsoft Managed Desktop devices and is pinned to the task bar. 

- End users can request a phone call, or chat online with a service rep.
- Requests that fall outside of Microsoft Managed Desktop support scope are redirected to the local IT helpdesk via phone call.  

Get Help is designed to be easy for end-user professionals to use. 

### Phone support

End users with Microsoft Managed Desktop devices also have access to toll-free phone numbers they can call. This is meant to be used when Get Help isn’t available. For example, if they can’t sign in to the device, or the device is broken. Here are the phone numbers for phone support:

- United States: [+1 (855) 425-0216](tel:+1 855 425 0216)
- United Kingdom: [+44 20 7660 1135](tel:+44 20 7660 1135)

## Hardware replacement

Hardware devices are replaced for items under the terms of the warranty you select. Devices are refreshed at the end of your Device-as-a-Service term, as is their attached warranty. Devices that need to be replaced for reasons outside of the warranty coverage will be assessed a replacement fee, e.g. lost or stolen devices. For a full list of what is covered under warranty, see [Surface warranty options](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4036296/surface-surface-standard-warranty).



## Severity definitions

Initial response time is the period from when you submit your support request to when an Microsoft Managed Desktop Engineer contacts you and starts working on your support request. The initial response time varies with the Business Impact of the request (also known as Severity).
