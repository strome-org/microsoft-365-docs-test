# Get support for Microsoft Managed Desktop

Microsoft Managed Desktop devices are managed by and will be repaired or replaced by Microsoft when needed.

## What's included?

Microsoft Managed Desktop support:

- Provides a team of support engineers dedicated to Microsoft Managed Desktop devices
- Supports Microsoft Managed Desktop devices and end users assigned to those devices
- Grants limited administrative access to Microsoft Managed Desktop devices for support engineers managing Microsoft Managed Desktop devices 

Supported products:

- Windows 10 with Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (WDATP)

- We are partnering with, not replacing, your corporate helpdesk; Line-of-Business (LOB) apps, network resources, etc. are still handled by your helpdesk 
- Non-Microsoft Managed Desktop devices are out of scope 

## Getting help: administrators

You can submit Support tickets or Feedback requests to Microsoft using the Microsoft Managed Desktop Administrative Portal. Support requests are always prioritized over Feedback submissions. Support requests will be reviewed and managed according to Severity as outlined earlier in this document. Feedback will be reviewed, and a response provided where requested. 

## Getting help for end users

There are two ways that users in your organization can get help with their Microsoft Managed Desktop devices: **Get Help** app, or phone support. 

### Get Help app

The preferred method for providing support to your users is **Get Help**.

This is an application that’s installed on all Microsoft Managed Desktop devices and is pinned to the task bar. 

- End users can request a phone call, or chat online with a service rep.
- Requests that fall outside of Microsoft Managed Desktop support scope are redirected to the local IT helpdesk via phone call.  

Get Help is designed to be easy for end-user professionals to use. 

### Phone support

End users with Microsoft Managed Desktop devices also have access to toll-free phone numbers they can call. This is meant to be used when Get Help isn’t available. For example, if they can’t sign in to the device, or the device is broken. Here are the phone numbers for phone support:

- United States: +1 855-425-0216
- United Kingdom: 442076601135 

## Hardware replacement

Hardware devices are replaced for items under the terms of the warranty you select. Devices are refreshed at the end of your Device-as-a-Service term, as is their attached warranty. Devices that need to be replaced for reasons outside of the warranty coverage will be assessed a replacement fee, e.g. lost or stolen devices. For a full list of what is covered under warranty, see [Surface warranty options](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4036296/surface-surface-standard-warranty).
