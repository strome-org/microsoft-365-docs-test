# Partner guidance for managed desktop services

As a Microsoft partner, you can help enterprises manage their workplaces using Microsoft 365 tools, plus your own combination of device and service offerings. 

You can use the Microsoft Managed Desktop (MMD) as a starting place to create your own end-to-end vision for a modern desktop. As a Microsoft solution partner, you can help introduce service offerings into global and new markets, and drive adoption and consumption of your own set of differentiated services, helping your customers adopt new technologies.

(Enterprises: want to find a partner near you to help get you started? [Find a Microsoft solution provider](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/solution-providers/search)).

## Prerequisites

When helping a customer get started with Microsoft Managed Desktop (MMD), start by helping them fulfill the [prerequisites](..\intro\prerequisites.md).

## Partnership in a Microsoft led MMD offer
MMD has four key areas of strong partner opportunities: getting customers ready for MMD, providing modern devices; deploying the modern desktop; and ongoing management.  All partners can provide services here for existing and new customers. Figure 1 shows the four key areas.

## Customer Readiness 
Partners  play a key role in ensuring that organizations are ready for MMD. We will rely on our M365 partners to enable MMD prerequisites. A few of them are discussed here:

As enterprises migrate to the cloud, legacy network architecture currently used creates bottlenecks, affects application performance and increase security concerns. We look to partners to assess, evaluate and enable modern networking solutions so that customers can maximize their investment. 

Office 365 and Azure Active Directory are crucial to the MMD offering . We look to partners to plan, deploy and migrate organizations to Office 365, including Exchange and Sharepoint Online and cloud identity with Azure Active Directory. To rollout MMD, it is not required that the full organization is migrated to all Office 365 services. Organizations that have a phased migration can enable MMD to parts of the company where Office 365 is implemented.

Corporate data and documents stored on OneDrive for business is automatically made available to MMD users and can be easily restored for MMD devices. The file sync and share capabilities not only provide easy collaboration amongst end users, the data is also available when devices are exchanged. Partners can help organizations migrate data from their existing solutions to OneDrive for Business. 
Most organizations also have a large portfolio of 1st party and 3rd party business applications, that includes existing Win32 desktop apps. Partners can provide an end to end solution that includes assessing application compatibility and application remediation services that enables application readiness   for Windows 10.  Partners have the opportunity to offer a full range of application management services from assessment of application compatibility to deployment on customers’ infrastructure across the various stages of MMD partner alignment.  This includes application packaging, application remediation and ongoing m

## Modern device 

There is immense opportunity for our OEM, Disti and Reseller partners to offer MMD on wide range of modern devices that meet the MMD device criteria . Partners can provide all functions required to deliver the full Device as a Service promise that includes device procurement, device logistics, delivery and returns, imaging  ,financing model for device lease, consolidated billing, extended service plans, peripherals, hardware support and other services. 
OEM devices will be made available in the preferred device list, in the MMD service offering or Partners can offer devices and include MMD ITaaS to be made available through the customers’ existing channels of distribution. 
To allow for simplicity partners should provide consolidated billing. This should wrap together MMD and partner services in a single bill, where customers are presented with an integrated cost for the whole solution per device, per month. 
Partners should also provide usage flexibility  with ability to add more hardware services at any time (scale up) or reduce allowing customers to adjust to changing business conditions.
Partners have additional areas of investments where businesses should have the ability to view subscriptions and usage for all Microsoft cloud services purchased, in their partner portal for easier management with one contract, one user account, one support contact, and one simplified bill.

## Deployment

In addition to PCs, most companies also have an environment that include IoT devices, smartphones, tablets, and allow employees to bring their own devices to work. MMD focuses on PCs within the customer environment, and partners play a crucial role in getting customers ready for deployment and ongoing adoption of MMD and Microsoft 365.  
This includes and is not limited to environment assessment for configurations, migrating services (eg printers) from on-premises and several other opportunities for partners to build on top of the MMD core service of tenant onboarding. 
As part of the onboarding process Microsoft will provision the MMD tenant environment, which allows Microsoft to take actions against the tenant, while operating within the scope of the required permissions. 
We also look to partners to provide deployment best practices for customers to overcome the challenges of deployment and adoption. This includes end user readiness assets, change management and communication strategies, and training for employee readiness that focuses on end user experience.  There also exist needs to create engaging and modern training modalities to increase use and adoption of all services and keep employees up to date with the latest technology. 

## Management

With the goal of simplifying IT, for MMD devices we include ongoing operations and management. MMD provides policy and device management via Microsoft Intune, application provisioning, monitoring and remediation of security alerts from Windows Defender ATP, telemetry-based reporting of device health and security and end user support.   
For a fully end to end solution, partners can extend operations and management to include all other devices and infrastructure services, and applications in the customer environment to ensure compliance, minimize security risks and decrease the costs of security management and operations. 
While MMD includes end user support both hardware for first party devices and Windows 10 and Office 365 Pro Plus partners have several options - 
Own the overall end to end support experience by including MMD hardware and software support into existing services. This will enable a consistent end user experience with the ability provide low cost solutions to customers.  
Build on top of MMD end user support, a federated end user support model where partners integrate with MMD support. For Microsoft 365 (Windows 10 and Office 365) end user support, customer has a choice between Microsoft and approved partner support. 
In both cases, MMD will also define API driven integration with partner’s support service such that there is bi-directional data sharing. Data shared with Microsoft will only be used for improving our products.  Microsoft will also investigate data sharing with partners to help reduce the overall support cost.
In summary, approved partner that owns majority of the services and customer relationship for a Microsoft led MMD offer. Partners will also continue to offer the unique /add-on services that customers value for their business.
Partner led offer
The above presents a partnership alignment and business opportunity for partners in a Microsoft led MMD offer. Partners may also build on the MMD ITaaS offering and below is a proposed model (#2 from the table below): 
•	Partners includes MMD ITaaS as part of its managed services solution 
•	MMD ITaaS together with Microsoft 365 E5 remain an EA motion through Microsoft field/sales channel
•	Partners gets additional incentives from selling MMD ITaaS as part of its solution 
A quick view on the table below:
•	#1: Microsoft led MMD offer
•	#3 : the current Partner led offer
•	#2 enables Partners to leverage MMD ITaaS without rebuilding those components and focus more on unique value-add services. It brings the best from both Microsoft and Partners to our shared customers. It also helps align our channels and avoid channel conflicts.
