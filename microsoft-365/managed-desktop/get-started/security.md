# Security in Microsoft Managed Desktop

<!--Security -->

By using many Microsoft technologies, we can ensure that Microsoft Managed Desktop devices are secure and that the Microsoft Managed Desktop security ops team can prevent, detect, and respond to advanced threats. Third-party security products, apps, and services are not allowed. Microsoft will apply a standard policy baseline to ensure devices, identity, network, and corporate data are secured and protected.

These categories of security enforcement are documented in the following sections:
- [Device security](#device-security) – ensure Microsoft Managed Desktop devices are secure
- [Identity security](#identity-security) – ensure users in the modern workplace are not compromised
- [Network security](#network-security) – ensure a secure access to corporate resources
- [Information security](#information-security) – ensure corporate data is secure
