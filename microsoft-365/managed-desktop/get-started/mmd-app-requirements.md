Microsoft may decide to remove any application or driver that negatively impacts performance and reliability of Microsoft Managed Desktop devices.

## Deployable using Microsoft technologies

Microsoft Managed Desktop uses Intune,  Microsoft Store, and  Microsoft Store for Business to deploy applications. Consequently, applications must be packaged in a manner able to be deployed by the then-current version of those services.

## Prohibited app classes

Certain application types are not permitted on Microsoft Managed Desktop devices:
- 3rd party anti-virus, security, or audit software
- Versions of Microsoft Office prior to Office 365 Pro Plus
- Applications that install or bundle other 3rd party software

## Restricted app behaviors

Certain application behaviors can be either be detrimental to user experience or present a security risk to Microsoft Managed Desktop devices. Applications shall not exhibit the following behaviors or characteristics: 
- Install background services or spawn long-running background processes
- Add itself to the Windows startup path
- Call undocumented Windows or Office APIs or take dependencies on internal Windows or Office data structures
- Act as an app store or have built-in extension manager
- Elevate the end user’s privileges
- Have known security vulnerabilities
- Signed using a certificate which doesn’t roll up to a trusted root
- Encrypt or restrict access to end-user data
