# Information protection for the Contoso Corporation

**Summary:** Understand how Contoso uses information protection features in Microsoft 365 Enterprise to secure their digital assets in the cloud.

Contoso is serious about their information security and protection. For example, leakage or destruction of their intellectual property describing product designs and proprietary manufacturing techniques would place them at a competitive disadvantage.

Before moving their sensitive and most valuable digital assets to the cloud, they made sure that their on-premises information classification and protection requirements were supported and implemented in the cloud-based services of Microsoft 365 Enterprise.

## Contoso's data security classification

Contoso performed an analysis of their data and determined the following levels.

||||
|:-------|:-----|:-----|
| **Level 1: Baseline** | **Level 2: Sensitive** | **Level 3: Highly regulated** |
| Data is encrypted and available only to authenticated users <BR> <BR> Provided for all data stored on premises and in cloud-based storage and workloads, such as Office 365. Data is encrypted while it resides in the service and in transit between the service and client devices. <BR><BR> Examples of Level 1 data are normal business communications (email) and files for administrative, sales, and support workers. | Level 1 plus strong authentication and data loss protection: <BR> <BR> Strong authentication includes multi-factor authentication with SMS validation. Data loss prevention ensures that sensitive or critical information does not travel outside the on-premises network. <BR><BR> Examples of Level 2 data are financial and legal information and research and development data for new products. | Level 2 plus the highest levels of encryption, authentication, and auditing. <BR> <BR>  The highest levels of encryption for data at rest and in the cloud, compliant with regional regulations, combined with multi-factor authentication with smart cards and granular auditing and alerting. <BR> <BR> Examples of Level 3 data are customer and partner personally identifiable information, product engineering specifications, and proprietary manufacturing techniques.  |

## Contoso's information policies
The following table lists Contoso's information policies.

|||||
|:-------|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|  | **Access** | **Data retention** | **Information protection** |
| Level 1: Low business value (Baseline) | Allow access to all  | 6 months | Use encryption |
| Level 2: Medium business value (Sensitive) | Allow access to Contoso employees, subcontractors, and partners <BR> <BR> Use multi-factor authentication (MFA), Transport Layer Security (TLS), and Mobile Application Management (MAM) | 2 years  | Use hash values for data integrity  |
| Level 3: High business value (Highly regulated) | Allow access to executives and leads in engineering and manufacturing <BR> <BR> Rights Management System (RMS) with managed network devices only  | 7 years  | Use digital signatures for non-repudiation  |

## Contoso’s path to information protection with Microsoft 365 Enterprise

Contoso used the following steps to prepare Microsoft 365 Enterprise for their information protection requirements:

1. Identified what information to protect

   Contoso did an extensive review of their existing digital assets located on on-premises SharePoint sites and file shares and classified each one.

2. Determined access, retention, and information protection policies for data levels

   Based on the data levels, Contoso determined detailed policy requirements, which were used to protect existing digital assets as they were moved to the cloud.

3. Created Azure Information Protection labels and their settings for the different levels of information

   Contoso modified the default Azure Information Protection labels with the titles that match their data levels and configured the Sensitive and Highly regulated labels to encrypt with Azure cloud key. They created sub-labels of the Highly regulated label for specific types of trade secret data and confined their access to specific research and development groups. Contoso also deployed the Azure Information Protection client to all Windows PCs and devices.

4. Created protected SharePoint Online sites for sensitive and highly regulated data with permissions that lock down access

   Both sensitive and highly regulated sites were configured as [isolated sites](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/enterprise/isolated-sharepoint-online-team-sites), in which the default SharePoint Online team site permissions were customized to Azure AD groups. Sensitive and highly regulated SharePoint Online sites were also configured with a default Office 365 label. Files stored in highly regulated SharePoint Online sites are protected with an Azure Information Protection (AIP) sub-label of a scoped policy. For more information, see the [Microsoft Teams and SharePoint Online sites for highly regulated data](teams-sharepoint-online-sites-highly-regulated-data.md) scenario.

5.	Moved data from on-premises SharePoint sites and file shares to their new SharePoint Online sites

    The files migrated to the new SharePoint Online sites inherited the default Office 365 labels assigned to the site.

6.	Trained employees on how to use Azure Information Protection labels for new documents, how to interact with Contoso IT when creating new SharePoint Online sites, and to always store digital assets on SharePoint Online sites

    Considered the hardest part of the information protection transition for the cloud, Contoso IT and management needed to change the bad information storage habits of the organization’s employees to always label their digital assets and never use on-premises file shares.

## Conditional access policies for information protection

In conjunction with their identity and mobile device management infrastructure and as part of their rollout of Exchange Online and SharePoint Online, Contoso configured the following set of conditional access policies and applied them to the appropriate Azure AD groups:

- [Managed and unmanaged application access on devices policies](identity-access-policies.md)
- [Exchange Online access policies](secure-email-recommended-policies.md)
- [SharePoint Online access policies](sharepoint-file-access-policies.md)

Figure 1 shows Contoso's resulting set of policies for information protection.

>[!Note]
>Contoso also configured additional conditional access policies for identity and sign-in. See [Identity for the Contoso Corporation](contoso-identity.md).

These policies ensure that:

- App protection policies define which apps are allowed and the actions they can take with your organization data.
- PCs and mobile devices must be compliant.
- Exchange Online uses Office 365 message encryption for Exchange Online.
- SharePoint Online uses app enforced restrictions.
- SharePoint Online uses access control policies for browser-only access and to block access for unmanaged devices.

## Mapping Microsoft 365 Enterprise features to Contoso's data levels

The following table shows the mapping the Contoso's data levels to information protection features in Microsoft 365 Enterprise.

|||||
|:-------|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| | **Office 365** | **Windows 10 and Office 365 ProPlus** | **EMS** |
| Level 1: Baseline  | SharePoint Online and Exchange Online conditional access policies <BR> Permissions on SharePoint Online sites | Azure Information Protection client <BR> BitLocker <BR> Windows Information Protection | Device conditional access policies and Mobile Application Management policies |
| Level 2: Highly sensitive | Level 1: Baseline plus: <BR> <BR> Azure Information Protection labels <BR> Office 365 labels on SharePoint Online sites <BR> Office 365 Data Loss Prevention for SharePoint Online and Exchange Online <BR> Isolated SharePoint Online sites  | Level 1: Baseline plus: <BR> <BR> Azure Information Protection labels on digital assets <BR> Office 365 Advanced Data Governance | Level 1: Baseline |
| Level 3: Highly regulated | Level 2: Highly sensitive plus: <BR><BR> Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) encryption and protection for trade secret information <BR> Azure Key Vault for line of business applications that interact with Office 365 services | Level 2: Highly sensitive | Level 1: Baseline |
