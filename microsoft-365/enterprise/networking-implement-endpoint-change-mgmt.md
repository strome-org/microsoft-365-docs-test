# Step 4: Plan for URL and IP address changes

*This step is optional and applies to both the E3 and E5 versions of Microsoft 365 Enterprise*

>[!Note]
>This step requires [Step 3](networking-configure-proxies-firewalls.md). If you have not done Step 3, you can skip to [Step 5](networking-optimize-tcp-performance.md).

The URLs and IP addresses used by the global Microsoft 365 network change over time, so itâ€™s important to plan for updates to these endpoints. For example, you may need to reconfigure your security perimeter devices with:

- New URLs for new services that will need unhindered processing
- Removed URLs for discontinued services
- New IP address ranges for new Microsoft network locations and servers on the Internet 
- Changes in IP address ranges for the different services

For more information about establishing an implementation plan for changes in endpoints, which includes being notified of changes, see [Managing Office 365 endpoints-Integration](https://support.office.com/article/Managing-Office-365-endpoints-99cab9d4-ef59-4207-9f2b-3728eb46bf9a?ui=en-US#ID0EABAAA=2._Proxies&ID0EAEAAA=3._Integration) and [Managing Office 365 endpoints-Proxies](https://support.office.com/article/Managing-Office-365-endpoints-99cab9d4-ef59-4207-9f2b-3728eb46bf9a?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US#ID0EABAAA=2._Proxies&ID0EAEAAA=2._Proxies).
