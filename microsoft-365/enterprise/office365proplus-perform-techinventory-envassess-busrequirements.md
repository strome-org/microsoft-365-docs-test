# Step 1: Review requirements

In Step 1, you review the requirements for deploying Office 365 ProPlus and make sure your environment is ready.

For detailed guidance, see [Best practices: Assessing your infrastructure](https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployOffice/best-practices/best-practices-assessing-your-infrastructure).


## Make sure clients meet Office 365 system requirements

Review the number and details of your client devices, including platform (Windows or Mac), operating systems, architectures (32-bit or 64-bit), existing versions of Office that are installed, and required languages. As part of this review, make sure that your client devices meet or exceed the [minimum system requirements for installing Office 365 ProPlus](https://products.office.com/office-system-requirements#Office2016-suites-section).

Finally, you should assess the deployment tools you already use in your organization, such as System Center Configuration Manager.

## Make sure you have enough Office 365 licenses

Make sure that all your users have Office 365 accounts and licenses, and that those licenses include Office 365 ProPlus.

## Make sure your network can support the deployment

Review your network capability, including bandwidth and distribution of client devices.

## Make sure apps are compatible

Identify your Office add-ins--including VBA scripts, macros, third-party add-ins, and complex documents and spreadsheets--and assess their compatibility with Office 365 ProPlus.
