In Step 10, you'll enable self-service password reset (SSPR) to allow users to reset or unlock their passwords or accounts. To alert you to misuse or abuse, you can use the detailed reporting that tracks when users access the system, along with notifications.

See the [instructions to enable password reset](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-passwords-best-practices).

As an interim checkpoint, you can see the [exit criteria](identity-exit-criteria.md#crit-identity-step10) for this step.
