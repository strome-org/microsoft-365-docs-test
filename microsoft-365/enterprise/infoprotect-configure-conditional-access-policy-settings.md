# Step 2: Configure conditional access policies

*This step is required and applies to both the E3 and E5 versions of Microsoft 365 Enterprise*

Conditional access policies are settings that specify the conditions under which access for a user or device is granted or denied. For example, you could configure a conditional access policy that permits access for a user under the condition that they use multifactor authentication.

In Step 2, you configure conditional access policies that provide additional security for sign-in and access to information for both user sign-in and for devices. There are two types of settings:

- **Common settings, regardless of workload:** For the details of common identity and device access policies for the baseline, sensitive, and highly regulated security levels, see [Identity and device access policies overview].(identity-device-policies.md) .
- **Workload-specific settings:** For Exchange Online, implement the settings in [Secure email recommended policies](secure-email-recommended-policies.md) for the three levels of security. For SharePoint Online, implement the settings in both [Secure email recommended policies](secure-email-recommended-policies.md) and [Recommended secure document policies](sharepoint-file-access-policies.md). 

>[!Note]
>Although these conditional access settings provide additional security for identity and sign-in, they also affect sign-in for devices and device access that rely on Intune settings implemented in [Phase 5: Mobile device management](mobility-infrastructure.md). For this reason, these conditional access policies are described here, rather than [Phase 2: Identity](identity-infrastructure.md).
>

The result of this step is that you have configured conditional access policies for common settings, Exchange Online, and SharePoint Online for the three levels of security.
