# Step 3: Customize the Office 365 sign-in page

*This step is optional and for both the E3 and E5 versions of Microsoft 365 Enterprise*

In Step 3, you'll help users recognize your organization’s sign-in page by adding your company name, logo, and other recognizable elements. 

With Microsoft 365 Enterprise, you can customize the appearance of the sign-in and Access Panel pages so they include your company logo, color schemes, and custom user information. 

When a user attempts to sign in from a device, they see something like the following example on the Office 365 sign-in page *before customization*.

And here is what the same user of the Contoso Corporation would see *after customization*.
