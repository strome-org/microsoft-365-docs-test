# Step 14: Allow users to create and manage their own groups

*This step is optional and applies to both the E3 and E5 versions of Microsoft 365 Enterprise*

![](./media/deploy-foundation-infrastructure/identity_icon-small.png)

In Step 14, you'll identify Azure Active Directory (AD) groups that can be managed by group owners instead of IT administrators. Known as *self-service group management*, this feature allows group owners who are not assigned an administrative role to create and manage security groups. 

Users can request membership in a security group and that request goes to the group owner, rather than an IT administrator. This allows the day-to-day control of group membership to be delegated to team, project, or business owners who understand the business use for the group and can manage its membership.

>[!Note]
>Self-service group management is available only for Azure AD security and Office 365 groups. It is not available for mail-enabled groups, distribution lists, or any group that has been synchronized from your on-premises Windows Server Active Directory (AD).
>

For more information, see the [instructions to configure an Azure AD group for self-service management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-accessmanagement-self-service-group-management).

As an interim checkpoint, you can see the [exit criteria](identity-exit-criteria.md#crit-identity-step14) for this step.
