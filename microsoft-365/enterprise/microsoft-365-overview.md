## Deploying Microsoft 365 Enterprise

There are two ways to deploy the products, features, and components of Microsoft 365 Enterprise:

   With FastTrack, Microsoft engineers help you move to the cloud at your own pace. See [FastTrack for Microsoft 365](https://fasttrack.microsoft.com/microsoft365).
  
2. Do it yourself

   The [Microsoft 365 Enterprise deployment guide](deploy-microsoft-365-enterprise.md) takes you step by step through building out the infrastructure and productivity workloads.
