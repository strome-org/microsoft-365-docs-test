# Mobile device management infrastructure exit criteria

![](./media/deploy-foundation-infrastructure/mobiledevicemgmt_icon-small.png)

*This applies to the E3 and E5 versions of Microsoft 365 Enterprise*

Before you move on to the next phase in the deployment process, ensure that your configuration meets the following requirements for mobile device management infrastructure.

- Intune is set up, including the creation of Azure AD users and groups to apply your organization's rules for devices.
- You have enrolled devices in Intune so that the devices can receive the policies you create.
- Apps are added to devices so your users get access to your organization's Microsoft 365 cloud services, such as Exchange Online and SharePoint Online.
- Features and settings are configured and applied to your devices using the Azure AD users and groups you create, which might include enabling anti-virus and restricting specific apps.
- Compliance policies are in place to require a firewall or a password length on a device. If devices aren't compliant, conditional access blocks access to your organization's data.
