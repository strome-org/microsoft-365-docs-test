# Step 4: Configure privileged access management for Office 365

*This step is optional and applies only to the E5 and Advanced Compliance versions of Microsoft 365 Enterprise*

Privileged access management is enabled by configuring policies that specify just-in-time access for task-based activities in your Office 365 tenant. It can help protect your organization from breaches that may use existing privileged administrator accounts with standing access to sensitive data or access to critical configuration settings. For example, you could configure a privileged access management policy that requires explicit approval to access and change organization mailbox settings in your Office 365 tenant.

In this step, you'll enable privileged access management in your Office 365 tenant and configure privileged access policies that provide additional security for task-based access to Office 365 data and configuration settings for your organization. There are three basic steps to get started with privileged access in your Office 365 organization:
- Creating an approver's group
- Enabling privileged access
- Creating approval policies

One configured, privileged access management will enable your organization to operate with zero standing privileges and provide a layer of defense against vulnerabilities arising because of such standing administrative access. Privileged access requires approvals for executing any task that has an associated approval policy defined. Users needing to execute tasks included in the an approval policy must request and be granted access approval in order to have permissions necessary to execute tasks defined in the policy.

To enable Office 365 privileged access management, see the [Configure privileged access management in Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/privileged-access-management-configuration) topic.

For more information, see the [Privileged access management in Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/privileged-access-management-overview) topic.

## Results

The result of this step is that you've increased the security of Office 365 by enabling just-in-time access control for key data and configuration settings for your organization.

As an interim checkpoint, see the [exit criteria](infoprotect-exit-criteria.md#crit-infoprotect-step5) corresponding to this step.
