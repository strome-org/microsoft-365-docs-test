# Phase 4: Office 365 ProPlus

In Phase 4, you deploy Office 365 ProPlus to client devices as part of Microsoft 365 Enterprise. In addition to this guidance, we recommend you use [Microsoft Fastrack](https://fasttrack.microsoft.com/office) to help with your deployment. FastTrack onboarding services are available with the purchase of 50 or more seats of Office 365 Enterprise and Office 365 Business plans, along with paid Government, Kiosk, and Nonprofit plans.
