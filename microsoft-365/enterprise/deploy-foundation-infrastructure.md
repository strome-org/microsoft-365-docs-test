# Microsoft 365 Enterprise Foundation Infrastructure

To fully realize the benefits of Microsoft 365 Enterprise, you’ll begin your deployment with its foundation infrastructure. 

## Foundation infrastructure for deploying Microsoft 365 Enterprise

The foundation infrastructure is the groundwork upon which you can deploy productivity workloads such as Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and Microsoft Teams in Office 365. It provides intelligent security and integration that simplifies ongoing management, which ensures that your client software is updated with the latest productivity and security enhancements.

You'll use the following phases to plan for and deploy the foundation infrastructure of Microsoft Enterprise 365 in your organization:

- [Phase 1: Networking](networking-infrastructure.md)
- [Phase 2: Identity](identity-infrastructure.md)
- [Phase 3: Windows 10 Enterprise](windows10-infrastructure.md)
- [Phase 4: Office 365 ProPlus](office365proplus-infrastructure.md)
- [Phase 5: Mobile device management](mobility-infrastructure.md)
- [Phase 6: Information protection](infoprotect-infrastructure.md)

Before you can exit each phase, you must examine its exit criteria, which is a set of required conditions that you must meet and optional conditions to consider. Exit criteria for each phase ensures that your on-premises and cloud infrastructure and resulting end-to-end configuration meets the requirements for a Microsoft 365 Enterprise deployment.

## Next step

If you have existing infrastructure for Office 365, Enterprise Mobility + Security, or Windows 10 Enterprise, see [Deployment of Microsoft 365 Enterprise with existing infrastructure](deploy-with-existing-infrastructure.md). This article steps you through exit criteria for each phase to more quickly determine what you need to change and make your IT infrastructure Microsoft 365 Enterprise-compliant.

Otherwise, you can begin your Microsoft 365 Enterprise end-to-end deployment journey with [Phase 1: Networking](networking-infrastructure.md).
