# Phase 2: Identity

![](./media/deploy-foundation-infrastructure/identity_icon.png)

Deploying the functionality included in the Microsoft 365 suite inside your organization can be a daunting prospect. This guide breaks down the identity aspect of your deployment into manageable chunks based on feedback from customers and partners who have been successful.

We break things down into the following groupings:

- Day 1 - 30
- Day 31 - 90
- Day 91 and beyond

Customers who have already deployed an identity solution may wish to reflect on this guide to see if they may have missed anything or if guidance has changed.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have Microsoft 365 E5 licenses. Much of the identity guidance will also work for those with Enterprise Mobility + Security E5. For more details about licensing see the following articles:

[Microsoft 365 Enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/microsoft-365-enterprise.aspx)

[Enterprise Mobility + Security](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/enterprise-mobility-security.aspx)

In Microsoft 365 Enterprise, a well-planned and executed identity infrastructure paves the way for stronger security and access to your productivity workloads and their data only by authenticated users and devices.

## Plan and deploy: Day 1-30

- Designate more than one global admin (break glass account)
   - Refer to this doc: [DOC](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-emergency-access)
- Turn on PIM to view reports [DOC](/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-getting-started)
- Use non-global administrative roles where possible
   - [DOC](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles)
   - Which specific features are needed, then you are likely needed to configure the following. Base it off golden config as an example?
- Turn on Identity Protection to view reports [DOC](/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/enable)
   - Remediate the users at risk (admin activity in the portal)
   - Take action on risky sign-ins (admin activity in the portal)
- Credential Management
   - Enable self-service password reset [DOC](/azure/active-directory/authentication/quickstart-sspr)
   - Password policy - Use same guidance from PDF + below NEED A DOC
      - Do not expire passwords, do not require long passwords, password complexity replaced by password protection
      - Password writeback (Included in Azure AD Connect)
   - Deploy Password Protection (preview) [DOC](/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-password-ban-bad)
   - For ADFS, use Smart Lockout (2016) or Extranet Lockout (2012)
      - Why we do not recommend account lockout policies (not a modern way of managing accounts)
      - Azure AD Smart Lockout for non-ADFS [DOC](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-password-smart-lockout)
   - CA based MFA [DOC](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-getstarted)
   - SSPR/MFA Converged registration [DOC](/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-registration-mfa-sspr-converged)
- Azure AD Connect (PHS) [DOC](/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect#install-azure-ad-connect)
   - Implement Password Hash Sync [DOC](/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnectsync-implement-password-hash-synchronization)
   - Implement Passwrod Writeback [DOC](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-sspr-writeback)
   - Implement Azure AD Connect Health [DOC](/azure/active-directory/connect-health/active-directory-aadconnect-health)
- Enable group-based licensing to assign services to your users automatically as soon as they arrive in the cloud. [DOC](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/licensing-groups-assign)

## Plan and deploy: Day 31-90

- Enable sign in risk and user risk policy automation (based on golden config recs) NEED A DOC
- Decide on external user strategy [DOC](/azure/active-directory/b2b/what-is-b2b)
- Decide on user lifecycle management strategy NEED A DOC
- Decide on device join strategy [DOC](/azure/active-directory/devices/overview)
   - Use Azure AD Join with Windows 10 devices [DOC](/azure/active-directory/devices/azuread-joined-devices-frx)
   - Use B2B for new external users [DOC](/azure/active-directory/b2b/add-user-without-invite)
- Enable Windows Hello for Business on all Windows 10 PCs + Authenticator App for passwordless [DOC](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-identity-verification)

## Plan and deploy: Day 90 and beyond

- Remove just in time access eligible admins that no longer need access
   - Refer to [DOC](/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-how-to-add-role-to-user)
- Require just in time access for global administrators
   - Refer to [DOC](/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-how-to-add-role-to-user)
- Configure reoccurring access reviews for all administrator roles

      - Use group-based access management/ provisioning to automatically provision users for SaaS applications. [DOC](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-access-management)
   - Migrate your external accounts to Azure AD B2B collaboration [DOC](/azure/active-directory/b2b/hybrid-cloud-to-on-premises)
