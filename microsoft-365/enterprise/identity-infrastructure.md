# Phase 2: Identity

In Microsoft 365 Enterprise, a well-planned and executed identity infrastructure paves the way for stronger security and access to your productivity workloads and their data only by authenticated users and devices.

>[!Note]
>If you already have an identity infrastructure deployed, please see the [identity exit criteria](identity-exit-criteria.md) to make sure that you meet the required and optional conditions for Microsoft 365 Enterprise.

## Plan and deploy your Microsoft 365 Enterprise identity infrastructure 

Use the following steps to plan and deploy your new identity infrastructure in the cloud. You can also use these steps to adapt your existing on-premises or hybrid identity infrastructure to work with Microsoft 365 Enterprise. 

- [Step 1: Plan for users and groups](identity-plan-users-groups.md)
- [Step 2: Synchronize directories](identity-azure-ad-connect.md)
- [Step 3: Customize the Office 365 sign-in page](identity-customize-office-365-sign-in.md)
- [Step 4: Monitor synchronization health](identity-azure-ad-connect-health.md)
- [Step 5: Protect global administrator accounts](identity-designate-protect-admin-accounts.md)
- [Step 6: Set up on-demand global administrators](identity-privileged-identity-management.md)
- [Step 7: Set up multi-factor authentication](identity-multi-factor-authentication.md)
- [Step 8: Simplify user sign-in](identity-single-sign-on.md)
- [Step 9: Simplify password updates](identity-password-writeback.md)
- [Step 10: Simplify password resets](identity-password-reset.md)
- [Step 11: Set up automatic licensing](identity-group-based-licensing.md)
- [Step 12: Set up dynamic group membership](identity-automatic-group-membership.md)
- [Step 13: Monitor tenant and sign-in activity](identity-azure-ad-access-usage-reporting.md)
- [Step 14: Allow users to create and manage their own groups](identity-self-service-group-management.md)
- [Step 15: Protect against credential compromise](identity-azure-ad-identity-protection.md)
- [Step 16: Provide secure remote access to users](identity-azure-ad-application-proxy.md)

When you've completed these steps, go to the [exit criteria](identity-exit-criteria.md) for this phase to ensure that you meet the required and optional conditions for Microsoft 365 Enterprise.
