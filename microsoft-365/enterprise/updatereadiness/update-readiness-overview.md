# Desktop Analytics

{Basic overview; links to subtopics showing basic user flow}

## Intro/overview material
{stolen from a recent e-mail}
Desktop Analytics tool provides you with these key benefits relating to Desktop Analytics for the Modern Workplace offerings of Windows 10 and Office 365 ProPlus:

- Device and software inventory, including apps, add-ins, and macros, versions of Office and Windows, and more.
- Pilot identification, including automatically identifying the smallest set of devices that will provide the widest coverage of apps, add-ins, macros, and other factors important for early piloting. This will allow for efficient and effective piloting of Office and Windows upgrades/updates such that customers can proceed more quickly – and with more confidence – to broad deployments.
- Issue identification and mitigation suggestions, backed by broad market and within-tenant data that is appropriately leveraged to predict where there likely are – and aren’t – issues.
- Tight integration with SCCM, which makes the Desktop Analytics data quickly actionable for deploying and managing Windows and Office.
