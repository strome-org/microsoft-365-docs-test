# Step 7: Synchronize identities

*This step is required for hybrid environments and applies to both the E3 and E5 versions of Microsoft 365 Enterprise*

In this step, you'll synchronize your on-premises Windows Server Active Directory (AD) with the Azure Active Directory (AD) tenant used by your Office 365 and Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) subscriptions.

Azure AD Connect is the supported Microsoft tool that guides you through synchronizing only the identities you really need from single or multi-forest Windows Server AD environments to your Azure AD tenant.

*How Azure AD Connect synchronizes your on-premises directory with Azure AD*

The first decision in your hybrid identity solution is your authentication requirement. The following options are options:

- With **managed authentication**, Azure AD handles the authentication process for user sign-in. There are two methods for managed authentication: 
    - **Password Hash Sync (PHS)** [Recommended and required for some premium features]. This is the simplest way to enable authentication for on-premises directory objects in Azure AD. Azure AD Connect extracts the hashed password from Windows Server AD, does extra security processing on the password, and saves it in Azure AD. For more information, see [Implement password hash synchronization with Azure AD Connect sync](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnectsync-implement-password-synchronization).
    - **Pass-through Authentication (PTA)** provides a simple password validation solution for Azure AD-based services. PTA uses an agent running on one or more on-premises servers to validate the user authentications directly with your on-premises Windows Server AD. For more information, see [User sign-in with Azure Active Directory Pass-through Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-pass-through-authentication).
- With **federated authentication**, the authentication process is redirected to another identity provider through an identity federation server, such as Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), for a userâ€™s sign-in. The identity provider can provide additional authentication methods, such as smartcard-based authentication. For more information, see [Choosing the right authentication method for your Azure Active Directory hybrid identity solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/azure-ad-choose-authn).

After you've determined your hybrid identity solution, download and run the [IdFix Directory Synchronization Error Remediation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=36832) to analyze your Windows Server AD for issues.

After resolving all of the issues identified by the IdFix tool, see [Implement password hash synchronization](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnectsync-implement-password-hash-synchronization) for guidance on installing the Azure AD Connect tool and configuring directory synchronization between your on-premises Windows Server AD and the Azure AD tenant for your Office 365 and EMS subscriptions. After synchronization starts, you'll maintain your user accounts and groups with your on-premises identity provider, such as Windows Server AD.

Microsoft provides a set of recommendations for [identity and device access](microsoft-365-policies-configurations.md) to ensure a secure and productive workforce. 
- For recommended requirements for hybrid environments, see the **Active Directory with password hash sync** column in [prerequisites](identity-access-prerequisites.md#prerequisites). 

- For recommended requirements for cloud only environments, see the **Cloud only** column in [prerequisites](identity-access-prerequisites.md#prerequisites).
