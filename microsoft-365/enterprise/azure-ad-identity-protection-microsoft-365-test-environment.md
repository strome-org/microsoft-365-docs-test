# Azure AD Identity Protection for your Microsoft 365 Enterprise test environment

Azure AD Identity Protection allows you to detect potential vulnerabilities affecting your organizationâ€™s identities, configure automated responses, and investigate incidents. This article describes how to enable Azure AD Identity Protection and view the analysis of your test environment accounts.

There are two phases to setting up Azure AD Identity Protection in your Microsoft 365 Enterprise test environment:

1. Create the Microsoft 365 Enterprise test environment.
2. Enable and use Azure AD Identity Protection.

## Phase 1: Build out your Microsoft 365 Enterprise test environment

If you just want to test Azure AD Identity Protection in a lightweight way with the minimum requirements, follow the instructions in [Lightweight base configuration](lightweight-base-configuration-microsoft-365-enterprise.md).
  
If you want to test Azure AD Identity Protection in a simulated enterprise, follow the instructions in [Pass-through authentication](pass-through-auth-m365-ent-test-environment.md).
  
> [!NOTE]
> Testing Azure AD Identity Protection does not require the simulated enterprise test environment, which includes a simulated intranet connected to the Internet and directory synchronization for a Windows Server AD forest. It is provided here as an option so that you can test Azure AD Identity Protection and experiment with it in an environment that represents a typical organization. 
  
## Phase 2: Enable and use Azure AD Identity Protection

1. Open a private instance of your browser and sign in to the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) with the global administrator account of your Microsoft 365 Enterprise test environment.
2. In the Azure portal, click **All services > Marketplace**.
3. Type **Azure AD Identity Protection** and then click it.
4. On the **Getting Started** blade, click **Onboard** under **Settings**, click **Pin to dashboard**, and then click **Create**.
5. In the Azure portal, click **Azure AD Identity Protection** on the dashboard. 

   You should see an **Azure AD Identity Protection-Overview** blade with a dashboard. Under **Vulnerabilities**, notice that it determined the number of user accounts without multi-factor authentication registration. This number will vary based on previous Microsoft 365 Enterprise Test Lab Guides that you have done.

6. Click through the categories for **Investigate** to see if there are any users or events that have been detected.

For further testing and experimentation, see [Simulating risk events](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-identityprotection-playbook).

See the [Protect against credential compromise](identity-azure-ad-identity-protection.md) step in the Identity phase for information and links to deploy Azure AD Identity Protection in production.
