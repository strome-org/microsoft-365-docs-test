# Step 5: Optimize client and Office 365 service performance

*This step is optional and applies to both the E3 and E5 versions of Microsoft 365 Enterprise*

You can increase performance by fine tuning the way that the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) works between client devices and Office 365 services.

For client devices, you can change the following TCP settings on client devices to optimize TCP performance:

- [TCP window scaling](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/onthewire/2014/03/28/ensuring-your-office-365-network-connection-isnt-throttled-by-your-proxy/), so your client device can send more data before requiring an acknowledgement
- [TCP idle time](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/onthewire/2014/03/04/network-perimeters-tcp-idle-session-settings-for-outlook-on-office-365/), so your client device can handle open connections more efficiently
- [TCP maximum segment size](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/onthewire/2014/06/27/checking-your-tcp-packets-are-pulling-their-weight-tcp-max-segment-size-or-mss/), so your client device can send the largest blocks of data in a packet
- [TCP selective acknowledgements](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/onthewire/2014/06/27/ensuring-your-tcp-stack-isnt-throwing-data-away/), so your client device can acknowledge received data more efficiently
