# Deploy Microsoft 365 Enterprise

Microsoft 365 Enterprise is a combination of Office 365, Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS), and Windows 10 Enterprise that: 

- Has intelligent security.
- Is integrated for simplicity.
- Unlocks creativity.
- Is built for teamwork.

These benefits are not realized just by obtaining the licenses for these three products, but by deploying them and their features in a specific way. This documentation set guides you through that deployment and the correct and required configuration of these products and their features.

There are two main phases to deploying Microsoft 365 Enterprise:

1. First, deploy the required [foundation infrastructure](deploy-foundation-infrastructure.md) for built-in security and integration for simplified management, which makes it easier to ensure your client software is updated with the latest productivity and security enhancements.
2. Next, deploy a set of optional [workloads and scenarios](deploy-workloads.md) on top of the foundation infrastructure, to unlock creativity and teamwork in your organization.

The following figure shows the relationship between the foundation infrastructure and the workloads and scenarios and your path through the content.

Security is built into all phases of the foundation infrastructure.

## FastTrack

FastTrack is an ongoing and repeatable benefit—available as part of your subscription—that is delivered by Microsoft engineers to help you move to the cloud at your own pace. FastTrack also gives you access to qualified partners for additional services, as needed. With over 40,000 customers enabled to date, FastTrack helps maximize ROI, accelerate deployment, and increase adoption across your organization. See [FastTrack for Microsoft 365](https://fasttrack.microsoft.com/microsoft365).

If you want to take advantage of FastTrack to deploy Microsoft 365 Enterprise, you can use the FastTrack [Microsoft 365 deployment advisor](https://aka.ms/microsoft365setupguide) for guidance on how to deploy and set up your foundation infrastructure. You must be signed on as a global administrator in an Office 365 or Microsoft 365 tenant in order to access this page.

## Take a test drive

Play with Microsoft 365 Enterprise prior to production deployment or the deployment of specific options with Test Lab Guides (TLGs). TLGs are modular, prescriptive articles that step you through the configuration of infrastructure or a feature in a simplified but representative environment using trial or paid subscriptions. 

With TLGs, you can demonstrate, customize, or build a proof of concept of a complex configuration, workload, or end-to-end scenario.

For more information, see [Microsoft 365 Enterprise Test Lab Guides](m365-enterprise-test-lab-guides.md).
