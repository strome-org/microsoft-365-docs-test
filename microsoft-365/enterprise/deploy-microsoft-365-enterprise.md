# Deploy Microsoft 365 Enterprise

Microsoft 365 Enterprise is a combination of Office 365, Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS), and Windows 10 Enterprise that: 

- Has intelligent security.
- Is integrated for simplicity.
- Unlocks creativity.
- Is built for teamwork.

These benefits are not realized just by owning the licenses for these three products, but by deploying them and their features in a specific way. This documentation set guides you through that deployment and the correct and required configuration of these products and their features.

Use the phases in the [Foundation Infrastructure documentation](deploy-foundation-infrastructure.md) to configure your organization for the requirements and capabilities of Microsoft 365 Enterprise.

The foundation infrastructure is the basis upon which you can deploy productivity workloads such as Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and Microsoft Teams in Office 365. The foundation infrastructure provides intelligent security and integration to make it easier to ensure your client software is updated with the latest productivity and security enhancements.
