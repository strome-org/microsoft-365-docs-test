# Password reset for your Microsoft 365 test environment

Azure AD self-service password reset (SSPR) allows users to reset or unlock their passwords or accounts. 

This article describes how you can configure and test password resets in your Microsoft 365 test environment in two phases:

1.	Create the Microsoft 365 simulated enterprise test environment with password hash synchronization.
2.	Configure and test password reset for the User 2 account.

## Phase 1: Create the password hash synchronization for your Microsoft 365 test environment

Follow the instructions in [password hash synchronization for Microsoft 365](password-hash-sync-m365-ent-test-environment.md). Here is your resulting configuration.

This configuration consists of: 
  
- Office 365 E5 and EMS E5 trial or permanent subscriptions.
- A simplified organization intranet connected to the Internet, consisting of the DC1, APP1, and CLIENT1 virtual machines on a subnet of an Azure virtual network. 
- Azure AD Connect runs on APP1 to synchronize the TESTLAB Windows Server AD domain to the Azure AD tenant of your Office 365 and EMS E5 subscriptions.

## Phase 2: Configure and test password reset

In this phase, you configure password reset in the Azure AD tenant through group membership, and then verify that it works.

First, enable password reset for the accounts in a specific Azure AD group.

1. From a private instance of your browser, open https://portal.azure.com, and then sign in with the credentials of your global administrator account.
2. In the Azure portal, click **Azure Active Directory > Groups > New group**.
3. Set the **Group type** to **Security**, **Group name** to **PWReset**, and the **Membership type** to **Assigned**. Click **Create**.
5. Click the **PWReset** group in the list, and then click **Members**.
6. Click **Add members**, click **User 2**, and then click **Select**. Close the **PWReset** and **Group** pages.
7. On the Azure Active Directory page, click **Password reset**.
8. From the **Properties** page, under the option **Self Service Password Reset Enabled**, choose **Selected**.
9. From **Select group**, select **PWReset**, and then click **Save**.
10. Close the private browser instance.

Next, you test password reset for the User 2 account.

1. Open a new private browser instance and browse to https://aka.ms/ssprsetup.
2. Sign in with the User 2 account credentials.
3. In **Donâ€™t lose access to your account**, set the authentication phone to your mobile phone number and the authentication email to your work or personal email account.
4. After both are verified, click **Looks good** and close the private instance of the browser.
5. Open a new private browser instance and go to https://aka.ms/sspr.
6. Sign in with the User 2 account credentials, type the characters from the CAPTCHA, and then click **Next**.
8. For **verification step 1**, click **Email my alternate email**, and then click **Email**. When you receive the email, type the verification code, and then click **Next**.
9. In **Get back into your account**, type a new password for the User 2 account, and then click **Finish**. Note the changed password of the User 2 account and store it in a safe location.
10. In a separate tab of the same browser, type https://portal.office.com, and then sign in with the User 2 account name and its new password. You should see the **Office Home** page.
