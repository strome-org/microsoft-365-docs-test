# Step 1: Check your Internet bandwidth

*This step is required and applies to both the E3 and E5 versions of Microsoft 365 Enterprise*

In Step 1, you check your current Internet bandwidth needs and adjust both central office and branch office Internet connections to support current and future traffic. For example, if your organization has a peak time for computing needs, such as end-of-quarter processing, you should verify that the Internet bandwidth in your central and branch offices can handle it. Be sure to allow additional bandwidth to handle unexpected surges in demand and for future growth. In addition, if you currently have either Office 365 or Intune, you might need additional bandwidth for Microsoft 365 Enterprise, which includes both Office 365 and Intune.

For more information about network connectivity considerations and network assessment tools you can use to determine your bandwidth needs, see [Network connectivity to Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/Network-connectivity-to-Office-365-64b420ef-0218-48f6-8a34-74bb27633b10). This article also applies to the combination of Office 365 and Intune in Microsoft 365 Enterprise. 

As an interim checkpoint, you can see the [exit criteria](networking-exit-criteria.md#crit-networking-step1) corresponding to this step.
