Windows Analytics uses diagnostic data to provide rich, actionable information to help you gain deep insights into the operational efficiency and health of Windows 10 devices in your environment.

Windows Analytics includes the following services.

### Upgrade Readiness
Upgrade Readiness provides powerful insights and recommendations about the computers, applications, and drivers in your organization, at no extra cost and without additional infrastructure requirements. This new service guides you through upgrade and feature update projects using a workflow based on Microsoft recommended practices. Up-to-date inventory data allows you to balance cost and risk in your upgrade projects.

See [Manage Windows upgrades with Upgrade Readiness](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/upgrade/manage-windows-upgrades-with-upgrade-readiness) to learn more, get started, use, and troubleshoot Upgrade Readiness.

### Update Compliance
Update Compliance provides a holistic view of OS update compliance, update deployment progress, and failure troubleshooting for Windows 10 devices. This new service uses diagnostic data including installation progress, Windows Update configuration and other information to provide such insights, at no extra cost and without additional infrastructure requirements. Whether it's used with Windows Update for Business or other management tools, you can be assured that your devices are properly updated.

### Device Health
