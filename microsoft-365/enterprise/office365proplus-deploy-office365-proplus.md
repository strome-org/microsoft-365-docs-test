# Step 3: Deploy Office 365 ProPlus


Before you begin:

- If you haven't already, complete the [planning for your deployment](office365proplus-classify-target-devices-deployment-groups.md).
- If you're using Configuration Manager, we recommend you use the Current Branch of Configuration Manager. With this version, you can deploy and manage Office from the Office Client Management dashboard. For more details on the Current Branch, see [Which branch of Configuration Manager should I use?](https://docs.microsoft.com/sccm/core/understand/which-branch-should-i-use)

## Update Group Policy settings
Make sure that you have reviewed and approved the group policy settings as part of your deployment plan, and then implement the settings. For more details, see [Best practices: Implementing group policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/deployoffice/best-practices/best-practices-implementing-group-policy).

## Create deployment groups

If youâ€™re using Configuration Manager, create a collection for each deployment group. 

If you're using the Office Deployment Tool (ODT), create a separate configuration file for each deployment group.
