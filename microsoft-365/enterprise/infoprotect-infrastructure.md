# Phase 6: Information protection

Information protection is a set of policies and technologies that define how you transmit, store, and process sensitive information. In Phase 6, you step through information protection settings and features of Microsoft 365 Enterprise that help you secure data for your cloud-based workloads.

>[!Note]
>If you already have already deployed information protection, please see the [exit criteria](infoprotect-exit-criteria.md) for this phase to make sure that it meets the required and optional criteria for Microsoft 365 Enterprise.

## Plan and deploy your Microsoft 365 Enterprise information protection infrastructure 

Itâ€™s important to work with your legal and compliance teams to determine if your organization needs to meet compliance standards such as HIPPA, CJIS, or GDPR. You should also work with your security group to determine the objectives for information protection.

Next, use the following steps to build out information protection for Microsoft 365 Enterprise.

- [Step 1: Define security and information protection levels](infoprotect-define-sec-infoprotect-levels.md)
- [Step 2: Configure conditional access policies](infoprotect-configure-conditional-access-policy-settings.md)
- [Step 3: Configure classification for your environment](infoprotect-configure-classification.md)
- [Step 4: Configure increased security for Office 365](infoprotect-configure-increased-security-office-365.md)

When have completed these steps, go to the [exit criteria](infoprotect-exit-criteria.md) for this phase to ensure that you meet the required criteria for Microsoft 365.
