# Windows and GDPR Records

This topic discusses how Microsoft documents Windows data processing activities.

## Compliance records

Microsoft keeps documentation on data processing where required by regulation, standards compliance, or internal policy. Many aspects of our personal data processing are governed by the following international standards that require records of processing:

* [ISO 27001](https://www.iso.org/standard/54534.html), [ISO 27018](https://www.iso.org/standard/61498.html), [ISO 27002](https://www.iso.org/standard/54533.html), [ISO 27004](https://www.iso.org/standard/64120.html), [ISO 27005](https://www.iso.org/standard/56742.html) — The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is the international standard that describes specifications for a holistic approach to information security that allows organizations to manage the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their information assets. 
* [PCI-DSS](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) — The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) is a set of policies and procedures to optimize the security of credit, debit and cash card transactions and protect cardholders against misuse of their personal information.
* [SOX](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ204/html/PLAW-107publ204.htm) — Sarbanes Oxley (SOX) standards govern privacy and integrity of financial data.

In addition, certain aspects of Windows products that process personal data are compliant with ISO/IEC 27001:2013 (certificate numbers IS 665452, IS 663486). You can find evidence of compliance for these components at ISO Reports:

* [Windows – ISO 27001-2013 Certificate for Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ViewPage/MSComplianceGuide?command=Download&downloadType=Document&downloadId=067b981f-1b44-4eec-ad82-9185b6c42e65&docTab=4ce99610-c9c0-11e7-8c2c-f908a777fa4d_ISO_Reports)
* [Windows - ISO 27001 Statement of Applicability for Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ViewPage/MSComplianceGuide?command=Download&downloadType=Document&downloadId=0a78b774-f69e-47bd-97f9-60176c08fd8e&docTab=4ce99610-c9c0-11e7-8c2c-f908a777fa4d_ISO_Reports)
* [Windows - ISO 27001 Audit Assessment Report for Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ViewPage/MSComplianceGuide?command=Download&downloadType=Document&downloadId=834d282a-a0f2-45a3-bc3d-22395145bad2&docTab=4ce99610-c9c0-11e7-8c2c-f908a777fa4d_ISO_Reports)

### Privacy reviews

Microsoft maintains a record of internal Windows privacy reviews, which play a key role in understanding what data is being collected, where it is being stored, who can access it, and any associated risks of non-compliance with GDPR. All privacy reviews require that a security review has been completed, approved, and recorded. For more information about the security review process, see [Data protection, security, and assessment for Windows](gdpr-data-protection-security-assessment-for-windows.md). All new Windows products and product updates receive privacy reviews before they are released to market, and products are reviewed annually to meet the privacy requirements of the GDPR. Privacy reviews include the following information:

* Purpose of processing the data
* Name and contact details of the controller 
* Where applicable, the joint controller, the controller's representative, and the data protection officer (DPO)
* Categories of recipients to whom personal data has been or will be disclosed, including recipients in third countries and international organizations

### Records storage
Microsoft stores compliance-related documentation on secure document servers with access controls in place. These security controls are designed to prevent the accidental or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, or disclosure of the documentation. The documentation is reviewed both internally with key stakeholders and externally by an independent third party at least annually. When we update documentation, we retain the older version in our archive.

## Microsoft account records
The data that Microsoft collects in Microsoft accounts (MSA) is tagged and stored in data sets. We update the information in these data sets in real time, along with the date and time of the update. The data is collected and transferred securely via HTTPS, encrypted at rest, and stored in a secured manner.

## Data tagging and tracking

Microsoft tags personal data (functional and diagnostic) with metadata labels to manage data throughout its lifecycle. Tagging enables us to identify and inventory the personal data sources and track the flow of personal data, including when data is shared (disclosed), updated, stored, transferred, and deleted. It also allows us to perform privacy actions such as deleting data upon request, and define privacy policies, such as data retention periods. Tagging also supports auditing, security, and compliance. For more information about security policies and reviews, see [Data protection, security, and assessment for Windows](gdpr-data-protection-security-assessment-for-windows.md).

## Disclosure of data

Data from Windows may be shared with the following third parties under some circumstances. Microsoft suppliers, third-party vendors and business partners are bound by contracts with Microsoft which govern how they are required to process data.

* **Suppliers and third-party vendors** — Microsoft sometimes shares data with suppliers and vendors who are processing this data on behalf of Microsoft. Our suppliers and vendors are contractually required to process the data with the same compliance to the GDPR as Microsoft. For more information, see [Service providers and contracts in the Data protection, security, and assessment for Windows topic](gdpr-data-protection-security-assessment-for-windows.md#service-providers-and-contracts).
* **Business partners** — Microsoft sometimes shares data with business partners, such as original equipment manufacturers (OEM), to help keep Microsoft products such as Windows secure. These partners are contractually required to process the data with the same compliance to the GDPR as Microsoft and use the data only for the purpose permitted by Microsoft.
* **Government officials** — Data is sometimes shared with government officials, where required by law. See [Responding to government and law enforcement requests to access customer data](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trustcenter/privacy/govt-requests-for-data).

## Privacy training certification

All Microsoft employees who have access to personal data from Windows are required to complete annual training that covers Windows privacy and security fundamentals, GDPR regulations, and best practices on how to prevent privacy breaches. We track training completion, and revoke data access for individuals who do not keep current with training requirements. In addition, Microsoft privacy professionals who have access to personal data from Windows must complete internal privacy training, and privacy managers must complete third-party certification with the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) to verify their knowledge of global and US privacy governance. Microsoft keeps a record of internal and external privacy training and certification.

## International transfers

Microsoft transfers data collected by Windows from the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland to other locations. When we do so, we adhere to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the EEA and Switzerland to the United States.
