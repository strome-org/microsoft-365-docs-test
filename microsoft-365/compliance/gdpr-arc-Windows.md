# Windows accountability readiness checklist for the GDPR

## Introduction
This accountability readiness checklist provides a convenient way to access information you may need to support GDPR when using Windows. The checklist is organized using the titles and reference number (in parenthesis for each checklist topic) of a set of privacy and security controls for personal data processors drawn from *ISO/IEC CD 27552 Information technology -- Security techniques -- Enhancement to ISO/IEC 27001 for privacy management – Requirements*.

[Compliance Manager reference.]

This control structure is also used to organize the presentation of the internal controls that  Microsoft Azure implements to support GDPR, which you can download [here](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ViewPage/TrustDocuments).
To purchase a copy of the complete draft ISO standard, please visit https://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail?pid=000000000030372571.
