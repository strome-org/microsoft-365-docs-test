## To set up a new Office 365 Education tenant

1. Go to the <a href="https://signup.microsoft.com/Signup?OfferId=03ee83a5-5cb4-4545-aca9-33ead43f222a,d764709a-7763-45ef-a2a8-db5b8b6ae704&DL=ENTERPRISEPREMIUM_FACULTY" target="_blank">Office 365 for Education sign up page</a> to sign up for a free subscription for your school.

3. Save your sign-in info so you can use it to sign in to <a href="https://portal.office.com" target="_blank">https://portal.office.com</a> (the sign-in page). Click **You're ready to go...** 
4. In the **Verify eligibility for Microsoft Office 365 for Education** screen:
  1. Add your domain name and follow the steps to confirm ownership of the domain. 
  2. Choose your DNS hosting provider to see step-by-step instructions on how to confirm that you own the domain.
 
    In some cases, you may need to wait several hours for the DNS verification to complete. You can click **I'll verify later** and come back later and log into the Office 365 portal and then go to the **Admin** center and select **Domains** to check the status entry for your domain.

    You may need to fill in other information to provide that you qualify for an education tenant. Provide and submit the info to Microsoft to continue verification for your tenant.  

As part of setting up a basic cloud infrastructure, you don't need to complete the rest of the Office 365 for Education setup so we will skip the rest of setup for now and start importing school data. You can pick up where you left off with Office 365 for Education setup once you've completed the rest of the steps in the walkthrough. See *Complete Office 365 for Education setup* in [Finish Windows 10 device setup and other tasks](finish-setup-and-other-tasks.md) for info.
