Hello, IT administrators! In this walkthrough, we'll show you how you can quickly and easily use the new Microsoft Education system, consisting of new and existing cloud services and tools, to implement a full IT cloud solution for your school.

## What is Microsoft Education?
**Microsoft Education** consists of these new and existing services and tools from Microsoft:
- **Microsoft Intune for Education** for simple set up, control, and management of the resources for your school including apps, devices, and settings
- **Office 365 for Education** provides online apps for work from anywhere and desktop apps for advanced functionality, built for working together and available across devices, and it's free for schools, teachers, and students
  - **School Data Sync** to help automate the process for importing and integrating School Information System (SIS) data that you can use with Office 365
  - **OneNote Class Notebook** to organize course content, create and deliver interactive lessons to some or all students, collaborate and provide private feedback to individual students, and connect with major LMS and SIS partners for assignment workflow
- **Microsoft Teams** to bring conversations, content, and apps together in one place and create collaborate classrooms, connect in professional learning communities, and communicate with school staff 
- **Learning Tools** are moving beyond the OneNote desktop app and is now available in Office Lens, OneNote Online, Word Online, and Word desktop
- **Whiteboard** to create interactive lessons on the big screen, share and collaborate real-time by connecting to Class Notebook and Classroom

## Prerequisites
Complete these tasks before you start the walkthrough:
- Make sure all the devices that you want to configure, such as student PCs, have the latest Windows 10, version 1703 image installed.

  We recommend Windows 10, version 1703 to take advantage of all the new features and functionality that Windows supports. This version of Windows is also compatible with the latest version of the Set up School PCs app and the versions must match in order for Set up School PCs to provision the devices. 

  If you don't have Windows 10, version 1703 installed on your devices, we recommend upgrading. This process takes a while so start this task before proceeding with this walkthrough. 

- Have an education-verified tenant to qualify for an Office 365 for Education subscription. You also need to be education-verified to use School Data Sync and Intune for Education.

  If you don't have an education-verified domain, don't worry. We'll show you the steps on how to do this. 

  > [!NOTE] 
  > If you need to get education-verified, it may take up to two weeks for the verification process to be completed.

## Setup options
 To make sure you have a successful experience with deploying and managing a full cloud IT solution with Microsoft Education, select the scenario that best describes your school or how you'd like to get started.

### <a name="noo365prodenv"></a>Option 1: Get started with Microsoft Education in a production environment
Trying out Microsoft Education in a production environment means you'll be using real school data as you evaluate the features and tools. This requires more time to get fully set up and going.

* Go to <a href="https://aka.ms/sdssignup" target="_blank">https://aka.ms/sdssignup</a> and fill out the form to sign up for School Data Sync and receive a free, one-on-one support from Microsoft.

  A team from Microsoft will contact you to help get started with Microsoft Education. 

If you want a quicker way to evaluate Microsoft Education, you can [use a trial environment instead](#noo365trialenv).

### <a name="noo365trialenv"></a>Option 2: Try out Microsoft Education in a trial environment
Once you get an Office 365 education-verified tenant, trying out Microsoft Education in a trial environment is an easy way to evaluate all the features and tools. Here, you'll use promo codes and sample files as you follow the walkthrough. 

To get started with Microsoft Education in a trial environment, follow these steps.

1. [Set up a new Office 365 for Education tenant](set-up-office365-edu-tenant.md).

  Wait for your tenant to be education-verified before proceeding with the next step. Verification can take up to a few days.

2. Once you have an education-verified tenant, click <a href="https://aka.ms/intuneforedupreviewtrial" target="_blank">https://aka.ms/intuneforedupreviewtrial</a> to apply the Intune for Education trial promo code. 
  1. In the Intune for Education Trial page, on the upper right, click **Sign in** next to **Want to add this to an existing subscription?**.
  2. Sign in with your global admin credentials. 

3. Sign in to <a href="https://portal.office.com/adminportal" target="_blank">Office 365 admin portal</a> and:
  1. Select **Admin > Users** and then search for your admin account. 
  2. In the user page, select **Product licenses** and expand the **Office 365 Education** license you assigned to yourself. 
  3. Confirm that School Data Sync is turned on.

3. Skip ahead and follow the rest of the instructions in this walkthrough beginning with [Use School Data Sync to import student data](use-school-data-sync.md).

### <a name="schooluseso365tryi4e"></a>Option 3: Try out Intune for Education
Already have an Office 365 for Education verified tenant? Just sign in with your global admin credentials to apply the Intune for Education preview trial code to your tenant and follow the rest of the walkthrough.

1. Click <a href="https://aka.ms/intuneforedupreviewtrial" target="_blank">https://aka.ms/intuneforedupreviewtrial</a> to get started.
